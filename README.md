# Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-NSL-KDD-Dataset-

## 1. Project Overview
The project is titled "Cybersecurity Threat Detection using Machine Learning (NSL-KDD Dataset)". It explains that you are detecting network-based attacks using a machine learning model (Random Forest) trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.

## 2. Project Structure

The Streamlit app (app.py)

Model training code

The NSL-KDD dataset files

Dependency list (requirements.txt)

This README itself

## 3. Machine Learning Approach
Briefly mentions:

The use of Random Forest

Binary classification: normal vs attack

Evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## 4. Features
Highlights what your Streamlit web app can do:

Upload files

Train the model

Display accuracy and metrics

Predict using custom user input
